# TheyLive
A quick and dirty kiosk displaying messages from the film They Live (1988)

# Brief
In this classic film there are number of hidden messages that are only visible to the 'others'. 

At work we have a display which hasn't been used in a while, I plan to hook up a Raspberry Pi Zero with a simple Pygame Python script to display brief flashes of the secret messages from the film. There are a few fans of the movie in the office so it should be good for a laugh. 

When not displaying a message the mouse pointer will be hidden and the screen will be black, emulating it's previous state.
